I am a quantitative field ecologist exploring the dynamics of populations and communities through the lenses of species interactions and intraspecific variation. I develop mathematical models and collect field data to test theoretical predictions of how individual-level traits and interactions scale to generate the structure, function, and diversity we see in natural populations and communities.
