I was raised in San José, Costa Rica, where my interests in species interactions and range dynamics were born. I received my B.S. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from Rice University after completing thesis research on the contribution of pollination patterns to creosote (*Larrea tridentata*) range dynamics in the Chihuahuan desert. In my doctoral research at DICE Lab, I am computationally exploring the consequences of using phenomenological models such as the competitive Lotka-Volterra to predict patterns of multispecies community assembly. In summer 2023, I will begin an experiment at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory quantifying the effects of plant-pollinator and plant-predator interactions on multispecies plant coexistence. Outside the lab I am a hiker, philosopher, poet, runner, and advocate for increasing access to science opportunities for low-income students and those facing other forms of financial instability.
