I am a sophomore at NCSU pursuing a microbiology degree with a concentration in microbial health science. As an undergraduate research assistant in the DICE lab, I am helping to examine microbial population dynamics and their response to various stimuli within their environment. After completing my undergraduate degree, I hope to attend medical school and eventually earn an M.D. With the rest of my time, I love going to the gym, rock climbing, and spending time with my dog!
