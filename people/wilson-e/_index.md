Emma is a senior at NC State University pursuing majors in Fisheries, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology and Plant Biology with a minor in Applied Ecology. She is particularly passionate about research that can be applied to improve conservation and management efforts in North Carolina. Emma joined the lab in spring 2023, and she is working on an undergraduate research project that explores how shade affects the growth and phenology of *Erythronium umbilicatum* to better understand the impacts of climate change, as well as the role that phenotypic plasticity plays, in the persistence of spring ephemerals.
