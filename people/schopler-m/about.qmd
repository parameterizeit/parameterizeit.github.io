Melina comes to the DICE Lab with expertise in population biology and intraspecific interactions. For her dissertation research, she's expanding this demographic lens to the community scale to understand how climate change will reshuffle pollination networks and plant fitness. In tandem with her science, Melina has cultivated a deep interest in art and is exploring how cross-over between these traditionally separated disciplines can help us better understand our world.
