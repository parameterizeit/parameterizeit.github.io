    "text": "La teoría de un rumor, Ulises Carrión (1978)\n\n\nHow will populations behave when the environment keeps changing? Climate change is altering the means, variances, and temporal autocorrelations of the key abiotic factors that underlie species performance. Understanding how these changes will impact species’ long-term fates is a key challenge that must be resolved in order to effectively forecast and mitigate climate change-driven biodiversity loss. Predicting the fates of organisms with simple, short-lived life histories should be relatively straightforward: These species should persist as long as the birth rate is greater than or equal to the death rate across the full range of future climatic conditions. However, many organisms have complex life cycles that span multiple years with individual demographic rates differing by age, size, stage, or sex. These organisms will experience climatic conditions over their lifespans that will range from historic norms to entirely novel conditions, potentially creating more ways the life cycle could break. The ability of species with complex, perennial life cycles to persist under climate change will therefore depend on their ability to successfully exploit climatically favorable years and buffer against unfavorable years.\n\n\nFor more than a decade, we’ve collected annual, individual-level demographic data on the long-lived, dioecious plant Valeriana edulis (Caprifoliaceae) across its broad elevation range near the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory. By fusing these long-term data with historic data and field experiments, we are building a demographic forecasting platform that grapples with the complexities of life history and the nature and pace of climate change. This will enable us to not only forecast the future size, composition, sex ratio, and fate of Valeriana populations, but confront these predictions with true out-of-sample observed data in future years. Inspired by this empirical work, we are developing theory to generalize our understanding of how populations behave under changing environmental conditions.\nThis long-term ecological research has been supported by grants from NSF DEB 1407318 and 1457029.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValeriana edulis growing at its current upper elevation range limit (3790 m).\n\n\n\n\n\nMonocarpic plants exhibit an unusual life history in which they grow vegetatively for several years before one spectacular season of flowering and seed production before dying. This strategy relies on the plant being able to slowly accumulate future fitness payoffs and survive long enough to see those returns. In 2024, we began working with David Inouye (emeritus at U. Maryland) on a high elevation (3740 m) population of Frasera speciosa (Gentianaceae) that he has censused annually since 1973. This is—to our knowledge—the longest running demographic study of any herbaceous plant. Frasera is extremely slow growing at this site, which makes it an excellent candidate for studying how sequences of good and bad years determine plant performance and population persistence.\n\n\n\nDavid Inouye (L) and Jake Davis (R) conducting the 53rd annual Frasera speciosa census. One individual has produced a column of flowers in it’s final swan song after decades of vegetative growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome species have large ranges, whereas others are restricted to very small areas that increase their vulnerability to extinction. In 2024, we began collaborating with Ian Breckheimer (RMBL) to understand the mechansims of local-to-landscape level variation in abundance in the Colorado rare plant, Physaria alpina (Brassicaceae). We are pairing traditional plot-scale demography with a drone-mounted advanced imaging suite to scale up our understanding of variation in plant performance. This work is advancing our understanding of fundamental plant ecology questions while simultaneously supporting conservation priorities of the Colorado Natural Heritage Program and the Colorado Parks and Wildlife State Wildlife Action Plan.\nThe seed funds for this work came from the Myrna Steinkamp Grant for research on rare plants from the Colorado Native Plant Society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual Physaria alpina moments before being imaged by the drone launching in the background.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPetry, W.K., Soule, J.D., Iler, A.M., Chicas-Mosier, A., Inouye, D.W., Miller, T.E.X., Mooney, K.A.

Therefore, seed production and plant population persistence must depend on pollination, but theory suggests that it may not be a simple, straightforward relationship. Understanding these relationships will be essential to effective conservation of plant biodiversity amid the mounting evidence for pollinator declines and increasing numbers of pollinator species in peril.\n\n\nPlants face uncertainty in the availability of pollination services that can drastically change their costs of reproduction from one year to the next. With collaborators Amy Iler and Paul CaraDonna (Chicago Botanic Garden), we are experimentally altering the amount of pollination perennial plants receive and following their demographic responses across the full life cycle. Our work is grappling with the role of trade-offs and stochasticity to better understand how population dynamics are buffered against (or susceptible to) changes in their species interaction partners.\nThis collaborative work is supported by NSF DEB awards 1754518, 2337426, and 2337427.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCensusing Hydrophyllum fendleri (Boraginaceae).

    "text": "Composition with circles and semi-circles, Sophie Taeuber-Arp (1938)\n\n\nPredicting the coexistence of two species in a simple Lotka-Volterra model has a tidy closed-form solution that is commonly taught in undergraduate ecology classes. But add a third species, and solving the problem suddenly becomes extremely difficult. Recent advances in coexistence theory have offered a path forward, and our research is confronting these approaches with empirical data.\n\n\nCommunities can take dozens to hundreds of generations for competitive exclusion to play out, greatly challenging our ability to test the predictions of theory with typical “fast” cycling macroscopic organisms like annual plants. The microbial communities of pitcher plants (Sarracenia purpurea) have generation times of several hours and highly specialized associations with their host plant. We are using this model system for lab and field experiments to probe the mechanisms of multispecies community assembly and coexistence. Furthermore, Ph.D. student Nicole Burroughs is examining the repeatability of community assembly and testing how variation in microbial dispersal determines the likelihood of alternative assembly pathways.\n\n\n\nCollecting samples from a microbial dispersal experiment in northern Michigan. (L to R: Nicole Burroughs, Ryan Hou)\n\n\n\n\n\nPlant species interact with each other through multiple intermediaries: resources, pollinators, and herbivores. Collectively, these intermediaries determine the net interaction sign and magnitude—ranging from competition to facilitation—and, ultimately, whether the plant species are able to coexist. NSF Graduate Research Fellow Alden Sears is experimentally decomposing these interactions in a community of wildflowers in the family Asteraceae that differ in the degree to which they share resources, pollinators, and herbivores.\n\n\n\nClipping flower buds to manipulate the density and species composition around focal plants in Colorado.

    "text": "Cosmic Thing, Damian Ortega (2002)\n\n\nProcess-level ecological data are usually collected locally, making scaling to the landscape and global scale a dubious exercise. I’m collaborating with three projects that seek to remedy this deficiency by using global databases & distributed experiments.\n\n\nIn addition to building demographic models and parameterizing them with field data, I am a member of the Science Committee for the twin databases of matrix population models, COMPADRE and COMADRE. Our goal is to enable comparative demographic studies by assembling a comprehensive database of demographic models and their associated metadata, then making it publicly available along with tools to work with the data.\nSee our blog for highlights of recent papers that have resulted from this effort, or download the latest versions of each dataset here.\n\n\n\nSpecies diversity generally increases towards the Equator, and the extent to which this affects species interactions will have profound biogeographic and evolutionary consequences. Despite decades of local experimentation and extrapolation, we still lack a globally-coherent picture of interaction strength.\nThe Global Dummy Caterpillar Project deployed plasticine caterpillar mimics around the world to measure predation rates by multiple taxa, distinguished by mouth marks left in the plasticine. We found strong evidence of higher predation in the tropics with a parallel pattern over elevation with stronger predation in the lowlands.\n\n\n\nPlasticine dummy caterpillar in Zackenberg, Greenland. Photo: T. Roslin\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographic models provide powerful insight into the life history processes that control individual fitness, population growth, and extinction risk. Demographic studies to-date are too poorly replicated in space and time to tease apart the complex ways that demographic processes respond to environmental variation—this is a key gap in our understanding of fundamental population processes made more glaring in light of global change, elevated extinctions, and species invasions.\nPlantPopNet is focusing on collecting demographic vital rates for a cosmopolitan plant, Plantago lanceolata, all over the world. By comparing individual performance across environments, we are beginning to understand how different life history processes respond to the environment and scale up to impact population dynamics.\nI established five replicate monitoring populations across a broad environmental gradient in California, from mediterranean southern climates to the mesic redwood forests of the north. These data will be pooled with ca. 25 other sites in the network to form the largest demographic database for any single species.\n\n\n\nPlantago lanceolata demography and leaf-level physiology at Norris Ranch Marino Reserve.
